##### What is Studio Ghibli Universe?

> This is our attempt to commercialize all the resources of Studio Ghibli including Films and merchandise.
  This would be a web application of the Studio Ghibli production company, which would include streaming services on buy/rent per movie basis.
  We could also buy merchandise such as t-shirts, action figures, posters, and much more of our favorite character, dialogues, props, etc.
  This site would contain extensive features such as description about the characters, locations, vehicles, etc. used in the movies.
  One has to add his/her favourite movies to wishlist before buying it and also delete it later if one does not wish to buy it.




##### Advantages of Studio Ghibli Universe:

> It is a one of a kind web app where we have combined shopping streaming and wiki features all together.
